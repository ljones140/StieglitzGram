At the time photography was seen as hobbyists pastime for bicycle clubs to record their travels. Stieglitz was instramental in getting fine art institutions (most notably MOMA) to the show the work of photographers alongide painters and sculptors.  He was was also married to painter Georgia O'Keeffe

Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).
